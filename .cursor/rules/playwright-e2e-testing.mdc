# AI Rules for Cook Mastery

Cook Mastery is a web app that helps people learn cooking fundamentals by combining curated tutorials and knowledge articles that explain not only how to do something, but why it works. The product focuses on beginner-to-intermediate learning where users can follow recipes but don’t understand principles such as heat control, ingredient function, technique choice, and equipment usage.
